## üöÄ Tech Stack & Architecture

This application is built with a modern, robust, and scalable tech stack, perfect for creating production-grade AI applications.

### Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components
- **AI/Generative**: [Firebase Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) with Google Gemini
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Deployment**: Ready for [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or other Node.js environments.

### Architecture

The application follows a clean, decoupled architecture:

-   **Frontend (`src/app`, `src/components`)**: The user interface is built with React and Next.js, using the App Router for clear, file-based routing. We use Server Components where possible for better performance. All UI components are from the excellent ShadCN UI library, which are styled with Tailwind CSS. The romantic theme is configured in `src/app/globals.css`.

-   **Backend Logic (`src/app/actions.ts`)**: Communication between the frontend and the AI backend is handled via Next.js Server Actions. This provides a seamless and secure way to call server-side functions directly from our React components without needing to manually create API endpoints.

-   **AI Flows (`src/ai/flows`)**: This is the heart of our AI. We use Firebase Genkit to define our generative AI logic. The `flirty-hinglish-chat.ts` file defines the prompts and logic for how the AI should respond based on the user's gender and message. Genkit orchestrates the calls to the powerful Google Gemini model.

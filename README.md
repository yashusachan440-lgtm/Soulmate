## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Vanika application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- A [Google AI API Key](https://ai.google.dev/) for using the Gemini model.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Open the `.env` file and add your Google AI API Key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
    ```

### Running the Development Server

You need to run two separate processes for the application to work correctly: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI flows.

1.  **Start the Genkit development server:**
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This will start the Genkit flows and watch for any changes you make to the AI logic in `src/ai/flows/`.

2.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    Open a second terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the main application on `http://localhost:9002`.

Now, you can open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002` to start chatting with your AI companion!

## üì¶ Building for Production

To create a production-ready build of the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized version of the application in the `.next` directory.

## üöÄ Deployment

This application is optimized for deployment on **Firebase App Hosting**. You can deploy it with a single command using the Firebase CLI.

For other platforms, you can start the production server using:
```bash
npm run start
```

Make sure to set up your environment variables (like `GEMINI_API_KEY`) in your production environment.
